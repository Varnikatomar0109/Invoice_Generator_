# Invoice_Generator_
This Invoice Generator is a Python application that automates the creation of professional invoices. The program allows users to input client details, items or services provided, quantities, and prices, and generates an invoice in a structured format (typically as a PDF). The generated invoice can then be saved, printed, or emailed to the client.
